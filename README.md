# Perl-6-Miscellaneous
This folder contains various documents on the Perl 6 programming language.

So far, I have included [slides for some talks](Talks) I made about Perl 6 at 
some French Perl workshops and [blog posts](Challenges-in-Perl6) related to the Perl Weekly Challenge.
 I might add more in the future.
